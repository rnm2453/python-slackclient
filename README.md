# python-slackclient
slack client v2.x implementation with python 3.7

Hello, This project centers around creating a Slack Bot in python using Slack v2.

This means, that instead of importing 'from slackclient import Slackclient'
We will Use 'import slack'

To create the bot and send the onboarding message, i heavily followed this tutorial
  https://github.com/rnm2453/python-slackclient-1/tree/master/tutorial
  
i used this tutorial as a base and i reccomend to check it before viewing the rest of my project.

The Folbowing bot can-
  listen to messages and have multiple replies
